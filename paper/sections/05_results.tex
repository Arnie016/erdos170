\section{Results}

\subsection{Deterministic Baseline}
The baseline sweep reports zero completeness failures in committed artifacts and
an empirical ratio envelope near the expected Wichmann-oriented regime.
Representative fixed points are:
\[
(N,m,E)\in\{(500,40,+1),(700,47,+1),(1000,56,+1)\}.
\]

\subsection{Cycle-1 Finite-$N$ E-Hunt}
The completed Cycle-1 summary reports no complete $m-1$ witness at the three
targets. Best near-misses are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.6em]
\item $N=500,m=39$: missing set $[493]$,
\item $N=700,m=46$: missing set $[690,691,692]$,
\item $N=1000,m=55$: missing set $[989,990,991]$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cycle-2 Live Snapshot}
Cycle-2 artifacts are tracked as an in-progress campaign. The generated tables
in this paper are auto-included from repository state at build time.
