\section{Conclusion}

This paper consolidates a reproducible finite-$N$ campaign for sparse rulers in
the context of Erd\H{o}s Problem 170. Deterministic constructions provide
stable complete baselines across tested ranges, while staged delete-and-repair
search at $(500,39)$, $(700,46)$, and $(1000,55)$ yields repeatable near-miss
patterns without yet producing a complete $m-1$ witness.

The contribution is therefore methodological and empirical: a robust artifact
pipeline, explicit interpretation boundaries, and synchronized publication
infrastructure. The asymptotic constant remains open.
