\section{Background and Framing}

\subsection{Known Construction Baseline}
Wichmann-style rulers provide explicit complete constructions and motivate the
classical $\sqrt{3}$ upper-constant narrative \cite{wolframSparseRuler}.
For computational work, this baseline is essential as both:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.6em]
\item a source of deterministic witnesses, and
\item an oracle to validate completeness checkers and endpoint handling.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Excess Parameterization}
Following common sparse-ruler practice, we track an excess term
\[
E = m - \mathrm{nint}\!\left(\sqrt{3N+\frac{9}{4}}\right),
\]
which separates ``construction quality at finite $N$'' from raw $m/\sqrt{N}$
ratios. In this campaign, excess reporting provides interpretable comparisons
across deterministic baseline and heuristic outputs.

\subsection{Interpretation Discipline}
When randomized sweeps produce zero complete hits for a fixed $(N,m)$, metrics
such as \texttt{best\_missing} measure \emph{search performance under budget},
not impossibility. Therefore, all claims here are restricted to verified
artifacts and explicitly avoid extrapolating no-hit runs into asymptotic claims.
