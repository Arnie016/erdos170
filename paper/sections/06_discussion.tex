\section{Discussion}

\subsection{What the Data Supports}
The current data supports a strong finite-$N$ statement:
deterministic constructions are reliable in the tested range, and staged
$m-1$ search repeatedly converges to specific high-tail missing-distance motifs.
This indicates structural rigidity in the current move classes.

\subsection{What the Data Does Not Support}
These experiments do \emph{not} establish the asymptotic constant of
Erd\H{o}s Problem 170. No-hit stochastic runs are not impossibility proofs,
and finite-$N$ outcomes cannot be promoted directly to asymptotics.

\subsection{Research Utility}
Even without a complete $m-1$ witness, the campaign contributes:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.6em]
\item reproducible benchmark artifacts,
\item stable near-miss taxonomies,
\item an automated publication pipeline that keeps reports synchronized with
      computational outputs.
\end{itemize}
