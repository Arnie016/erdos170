Erd\H{o}s Problem 170 asks for the limiting constant in the growth of the
minimum number of marks in complete sparse rulers (restricted difference bases).
This paper reports a reproducible computational campaign with two lanes:
deterministic Wichmann-style baseline generation and stochastic delete-and-repair
search for finite-$N$ improvements. We verify complete constructions in a sweep
$N=500,\dots,20000$ (step $100$), summarize excess behavior relative to
$\mathrm{nint}(\sqrt{3N+9/4})$, and run staged $m-1$ hunts at
$N\in\{500,700,1000\}$. Across completed certified artifacts, no complete
$m-1$ witness is found, while stable near-miss patterns persist in the high
tail distances. The results provide finite-$N$ structural evidence and
reproducible artifacts; they do not constitute an asymptotic proof of
Erd\H{o}s Problem 170.
